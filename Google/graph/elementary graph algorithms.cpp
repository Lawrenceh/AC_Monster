/* Topological sort: dfs based algorithm */
1. Call DFS(G) to compute finishing times for each vertex
2. return the reverse of the finishing times sequence vertices


/* Strongly connected components: KosarajuÂ’s algorithm - 2 pass DFS */
1. Call DFS(G') to compute the finishing times for each vertex (G' is G transpose or reverse)
2. Call another DFS(G) in order of previous topological sorting result (on G')
